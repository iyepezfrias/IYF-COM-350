		<p> <b>Hurricane Dorian</b> is beginning a much-advertised turn to the north-northwest, away from the Bahamas but toward the U.S. mainland, where it is expected to bring significant impacts. </p>

		<p> As of Tuesday morning, the storm was moving northwest at 1 mph just to the north of <i>Grand Bahama Island</i> and was continuing its historic onslaught in the northwestern Bahamas. The storm weakened slightly and was (very slowly) moving through Grand Bahama Island on Monday, with winds gusting over 200 mph and 18 to 23 feet of coastal flooding. Plus, the forward motion of the storm nearly stalled, moving west at just 1 mph. <br> The slower a storm moves, the more time it has to destroy communities in its path. Itâ€™s a worst-case scenario for a hurricane. Five people have been reported dead due to the storm, and the Red Cross estimates 13,000 homes have been severely damaged or destroyed.</p>
